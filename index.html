    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Taeho Kim, and I am studying computer science at BYU.<br>
       By learning Computer science, I want to create programs that benefits many people.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Evil Hangman</strong><br>
          In this project, I created a hangman game that is impossible to win unless you guess 26 times.<br>
          I used a datatbase store words that are not used frequently and as the user guesses,<br>
          the program eliminates and choose a list of words that would be harder to guess.<br>


        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Spelling Checker<br></strong>
          In this project I created a spelling checker. When the wrong spelled word is typed, the program<br>
          suggests a word that is similar to the typed word.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Family Map<br></strong>
        In this project, I set up a server and an adroid app for family map.<br>
        User has to register and log in to the app. Once the user is registered,<br>
        the app creates family data and make a family tree.
        </p>
